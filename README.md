# Sorting
Implementation of 6 different sorting algorithms, as well as a heap data structure (used for heap sort) and tests.

The main function is in file tests.cpp, and it essentially just runs the tests on each sorting function and prints out results. 

To run, compile with g++ -o tests *.cpp

And run with ./tests
